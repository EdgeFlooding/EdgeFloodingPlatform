## EdgeFloodingPlatform

Cloud/Edge flash flooding platform developed as part of the EdgeFlooding project. This platform prototype is exploited to analyze the performance of the system with different configuration, i.e. cloud and edge in particular (see https://edgeflooding.github.io/ for more details). 

# Camera module (camera.py)
This module emulates a surveillance camera generating video frames at a fixed rate. The frames generated by the module are extracted from real videos.

# Inference module (inference.py)
This module implements the image analysis functionalities. Inference is performed using the Inception convolutional neural network, version 3. The implementation is performed on the Tensorflow machine learning platform. 

# Aggregator module (cloud.py)
This module aggregates the results received by the inference modules and implements the social media monitoring functionalities.
